# Clinical-Genomic-Digital-Twin

## Background

Precision oncology aims to treat individual patients based on their unique clinical and genomic profiles. A Clinical Genomic (CG) Twin integrates a patient’s clinical data (e.g., cancer type, stage, co-morbidities) and genomic data (e.g., mutations, gene expression) to create a comprehensive profile. By comparing this profile to a database of similar patient profiles, OncoTwin identifies “twins” — patients with analogous characteristics — and analyzes their treatment outcomes to guide personalized treatment plans.

The OncoTwin project addresses key challenges in bioinformatics and clinical research:

'- Data Integration: Combining heterogeneous clinical and genomic data into a unified patient profile.
'- Scalability: Efficiently matching profiles against large databases.
'- Clinical Utility: Providing actionable insights for oncologists through a user-friendly interface.

This project proposes a Python-based tool, OncoTwinMatcher, to automate patient profile creation and matching, with a planned web interface for clinicians to input patient data and retrieve twin details.

## Project Proposal

### Objective

Develop an open-source tool that enables to:

Create comprehensive patient profiles from clinical and genomic data.
Match a patient’s profile against a database to identify similar patients (twins).
Access these features via an intuitive web interface.

### Prerequisites

To use or contribute to OncoTwin, the following are required:

Software:
'- Python 3.8 or higher
'- Git (for cloning the repository)
'- (Optional) Conda for managing environments

Python Libraries:
pandas (data manipulation)
numpy (numerical computations)
pyvcf (VCF file parsing, optional for genomic data)
pysam (BAM/SAM file parsing, optional)


## Database Creation

The OncoTwin system relies on a database of patient profiles, which integrates diverse data types:

Clinical Data:
Cancer type (e.g., breast, lung, colorectal)
Stage (e.g., I–IV)
Comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)
Prior treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation)

Genomic Data:
Mutations (e.g., BRCA1, TP53) from VCF files
Gene expression profiles (e.g., RNA-seq counts)
Copy number variations or epigenetic markers

Treatment and Outcome Data:
Treatment details (e.g., drug names, dosages)
Outcomes (e.g., survival months, response rate)



## Method

The OncoTwin tool implements the following workflow:

Profile Creation:
Input clinical data (e.g., cancer type, stage) and genomic data (e.g., mutation status).
Combine into a standardized patient profile (e.g., a Pandas DataFrame).
Validate inputs (e.g., ensure cancer type is recognized).

Profile Matching:
Use a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity) to compare the patient’s profile to the database.
Prioritize matches by cancer type or stage for relevance.
Return the top N matches (default: x) with their treatment and outcome data.

Output Generation:
Save matches to a CSV file or display via the interface.
Include similarity and key clinical/genomic details.

## Planned Interface

To make OncoTwin accessible to clinicians and researchers, a web interface is planned
