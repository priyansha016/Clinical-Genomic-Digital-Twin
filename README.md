# Clinical-Genomic-Digital-Twin

## Background

Precision oncology aims to treat individual patients based on their unique clinical and genomic profiles. A Clinical Genomic Twin (CGT) integrates a patient’s clinical data (e.g., cancer type, stage, co-morbidities) and genomic data (e.g., mutations, gene expression) to create a comprehensive profile. By comparing this profile to a database of similar patient profiles, CGT identifies “twins” — patients with analogous characteristics — and analyzes their treatment outcomes to guide personalized treatment plans. In the current project, the disease of interest is Breast Cancer.

The CGT project addresses key challenges in bioinformatics and clinical research:

Data Integration: Combining heterogeneous clinical and genomic data into a unified patient profile.
Scalability: Efficiently matching profiles against large databases.
Clinical Utility: Providing actionable insights for oncologists through a user-friendly interface.

## Project Proposal

### Objective

Develop an open-source tool that enables to:

Create comprehensive patient profiles from clinical and genomic data.
Match a patient’s profile against a database to identify similar patients (twins).
Access these features via an intuitive web interface.

### Prerequisites

To use or contribute to CGT, the following are required:

Software:
Python 3.8 or higher
Git (for cloning the repository)
(Optional) Conda for managing environments

Python Libraries:
pandas (data manipulation)
numpy (numerical computations)
pyvcf (VCF file parsing, optional for genomic data)
pysam (BAM/SAM file parsing, optional)


## Database Creation 

The CGT system relies on a database of patient profiles, which integrates diverse data types:

Clinical Data:
Cancer type (e.g., breast)
Stage (e.g., I–IV)
Comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)
Prior treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation)

Genomic Data:
Mutations (e.g., BRCA1, TP53) from VCF files
Gene expression profiles (e.g., RNA-seq counts)

Treatment and Outcome Data:
Treatment details (e.g., drug names, dosages)
Outcomes (e.g., survival months, response rate)


## Method 

The CGT tool implements the following workflow:

Profile Creation:
Input clinical data (e.g., cancer type, drug info) and genomic data (e.g., mutation status).
Combine into a standardized patient profile (e.g., a Pandas DataFrame).
Validate inputs (e.g., ensure cancer type is recognized).

Profile Matching:
Use a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity/k means clustering) to compare the patient’s profile to the database.
Return the top N matches (default: x) with their treatment and outcome data.

Output Generation:
Save matches to a CSV file or display via the interface.
Include similarity and key clinical/genomic details.

## Goals and timelines

1. Collect and Prepare Dataset : Download breast cancer data from online resources, focusing on patients with treatment response data for multiple drugs. Ensure the dataset includes response outcomes (responder/non-responder) for at least 3–5 drugs. (May 20)
2. Preprocess Data : Clean the dataset by handling missing values (e.g., impute numerical data with median, categorical with mode) and standardize features. (May 27)
3. Clinical Genomic Twin model : Implement a clustering algorithm to group patients by similarity based on selected features. (3 June)
4. Develop Multi-Drug Prediction Model : Train a machine learning model to predict responses for multiple drugs based on patient features. (3 June)
5. Create an interface : Build a basic interface to input patient details and output predicted drug responses. (10 June)
6. Test and Document : Test the prototype on a test dataset and document results for future expansion. (17 June)
[Buffer time : 2 weeks]

## Planned Interface

To make CGT accessible to clinicians and researchers, a web interface is planned.
